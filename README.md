Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality (Unofficial Port)

Rick and Morty have teleported directly into your living room! Experience the chaotic VR adventure from Adult Swim Games and Owlchemy Labs (creators of Job Simulator).

Explore Rick's garage, the Smith household, and alien worlds as a Morty clone. Step through portals, assist Rick with bizarre experiments, and grab everything you see with your own hands. Solve puzzles and complete missions featuring full original voice acting!

Features:
• Your favorite heroes now in 3D!
• Touch, throw, and smash everything (yes, even the Plumbus).
• Walk through portals into other dimensions with your own feet.
• Get yelled at by Rick and question your own self-worth.
• Smack Rick in the face.
• Real Fake Doors.

⚠️ TRACKING WARNING: High-quality tracking is not guaranteed on every smartphone. 6-DOF tracking capability depends on ARCore support and is currently highly unstable on Android devices. A Bluetooth controller (preferably Joy-Con style) is MANDATORY for gameplay. Hand tracking is limited by your smartphone camera's field of view (Ultrawide cameras are supported on Samsung and Apple devices).

Minimum System Requirements for Hand Tracking:
• Android 11 / iOS 16 or higher.
• Processor: Snapdragon 860 / MediaTek Dimensity 1100 / equivalent or better.
• The app may run on weaker devices, but stability is not guaranteed.

❗️ATTENTION: Tecno and Infinix smartphones may experience crashes and incorrect sensor behavior (gyroscope and accelerometer).❗️
